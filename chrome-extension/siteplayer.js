/**
 * CORS for a site that embeds MoviPlayer itself.
 *
 * The takeover feature already asks the background for
 * Access-Control-Allow-Origin on the files it is about to open. A site that
 * put <movi-player> on its own page gets none of that: its player asks for
 * the bytes, the host that serves them sends no CORS header, the fetch is
 * refused, and MoviPlayer falls back to the browser's <video> — which is the
 * thing the site embedded it to avoid. From the outside it looks like the
 * player quietly stopped working.
 *
 * So the same headers are offered here, for the URLs a page-owned player
 * declares.
 *
 * TIMING is the whole reason this runs at document_start rather than beside
 * the rest of content.js. A rule has to exist before the first read. The one
 * thing on our side is that a custom element is inert until its definition
 * arrives: <movi-player src="..."> sits in the DOM doing nothing until the
 * site's own bundle calls customElements.define and the element upgrades. So
 * an observer installed at document_start sees it while it is still a plain
 * unknown element, and the rules are written before it can ask for a byte.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated on the takeover exemption. "Off for this site" means
 * do not replace that site's video player — it does not mean break the player
 * the site chose to ship.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout: without the optional <all_urls> permission no rule
 * is written and the page behaves exactly as it did before the extension was
 * installed.
