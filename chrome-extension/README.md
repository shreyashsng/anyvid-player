# MoviPlayer Chrome Extension

Play any video URL with MoviPlayer directly in Chrome.

For real Chrome Web Store screenshots, promotional tiles, and the repeatable
capture workflow, see [STORE-ASSETS.md](./STORE-ASSETS.md).

This folder is also the **source of truth for the Firefox add-on** — everything
except `manifest.json` is copied into [`../firefox-extension/`](../firefox-extension/)
by its `build.sh`. Keep changes here browser-agnostic (no bare `window.chrome`
checks, no unconditional `chrome://` links); see the settings block at the
bottom of `player.js` for the pattern.

## Features

- **Take over page videos** (off by default, in the player page's settings) —
  a site's own `<video>` is replaced by Movi, so a file the browser refuses
  plays where it already is. Only a `<video>` playing a file at a URL is taken:
  the streaming sites feed their element from JavaScript (MSE, DRM), and those
  are left alone, so YouTube, Netflix and the rest are untouched. Nothing is
  injected into a page until one of those files is actually on it — the player
  is megabytes of WebAssembly and a page that has no use for it must not pay.
  A file on another origin needs an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` the site was
  never asked to send, so with site access granted the extension adds that
  header itself (one `declarativeNetRequest` session rule, for that one URL, in
  that one tab, gone when the tab is). Without site access nothing breaks: the
  player falls back to the native element, which is as good as the browser's
  own decoders and no better. That fallback is the whole point of the setting
  going missing, so it is said out loud rather than guessed at: the settings
  row carries a **Grant access** button whenever the switch is on without it,
  and the page's console names the reason once
- **ChromeOS Files app** — the extension registers as a file handler, so
  double-clicking a video in Files opens it here (multi-select becomes a
  playlist). ChromeOS + Chrome 120 or newer; everywhere else the code is inert
- **Next / Previous in the player** — a folder or multi-select is handed to the
  element's own queue, so the bar gets skip buttons, Shift+N / Shift+P work, and
  the OS media keys and lock screen carry the skip pair. The items are src-less:
  the element owns the controls, this page still does the loading
- **Works in incognito** — `"incognito": "split"`, so the player page opens in
  the incognito window it was launched from rather than being pushed into a
  normal one. Still has to be allowed at `chrome://extensions` first
- **Play button overlay** on video links detected on any page
- **Right-click context menu** → "Open with MoviPlayer" on any link
- **Toolbar icon** opens the player page — pick files, paste a link, and the
  two settings all live there (there is no popup)
- **Back arrow in the title bar** returns to that picker without losing what is
  playing — close it or press Escape to go back to the video, and it picks up
  where it left off if it was running. Not shown in fullscreen
  (`titlemode="back-windowed"`), where the title still is
- Supports: MP4, MKV, WebM, MOV, TS, AVI, HLS (`.m3u8`), MPEG-DASH (`.mpd`), HEVC, AV1, HDR

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Build movi-player dist
cd ..
npm run build:ts

# 2. Copy dist into extension
cp -r dist chrome-extension/dist

# 3. Add icon files (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 PNG) to icons/

# 4. Load in Chrome
#    → chrome://extensions
#    → Enable "Developer mode"
#    → "Load unpacked" → select this folder
```

## How it works

- **Content Script** scans every page for `<a>` tags with video extensions (.mp4, .mkv, etc.) and adds a play button
- **Background Script** handles context menu clicks and opens player tab
- **Player Page** loads `movi-player` element with the video URL — full controls, seek, subtitles, HDR
- **No server needed** — everything runs locally in the browser via WASM

## The `file_handlers` warning

Loading this on anything but ChromeOS puts a warning on the extension's card:

> `'file_handlers'` is only allowed for packaged apps, but this is a extension.

It is a warning, not a load failure, and the key is deliberate. `file_handlers`
was a packaged-app key first; ChromeOS 120 opened it to extensions so they can
appear in the Files app's "Open with". Desktop Chrome has no extension-side
implementation, falls back to the old apps-only check, and says so. The key
does nothing there and breaks nothing.

It stays in the one package on purpose: ChromeOS users install the same Chrome
extension as everyone else, and a second ChromeOS-only build would be two
packages to keep in step for one manifest key. **Don't delete it to silence the
warning** — that is the ChromeOS Files app integration.

## COOP/COEP Note

SharedArrayBuffer requires COOP/COEP headers. The extension's player page runs in an extension context where these are available. For cross-origin videos, the extension fetches via its own context which bypasses CORS restrictions.
