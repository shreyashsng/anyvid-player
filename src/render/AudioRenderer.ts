    // stopped and forgotten, with scheduledTime pulled to `now` on the reasoning
    // that the next decoded chunk would then play immediately. It does not: that
    // chunk's media time is a full SCHEDULE_LOOKAHEAD past the playhead, because
    // that is precisely the span just discarded, and the scheduler honours the
    // media timeline — it puts the chunk where its PTS says it belongs and fills
    // the space in front with silence. One second of scheduled audio dropped is
    // therefore one second of hole, and the picture, which follows the audio
    // clock, stops with it. That is the interruption on every speed change.
    //
    // Nothing about that audio was wrong except its rate, and the buffers it was
    // built from are still to hand (see sourceOrigin). So the sources that have
    // not begun are stopped and their ORIGINAL buffers pushed back onto the
    // pending queue, in order, to be stretched again at the new rate and
    // rescheduled behind whatever is playing right now. No media is skipped, so
    // there is no hole to fill; the seam is a buffer boundary that was never
    // heard.
    //
    // The one source already playing is left alone. It finishes at the old rate
    // — a chunk, tens of milliseconds — and is the bridge across the change
    // rather than a click to be faded over.
    //
    // Crucially we do NOT clear firstBufferMediaTime / hasFirstBuffer the way
    // reset() does. Keeping the anchor (mapped through the OLD rate up to now)
    // means the next chunk schedules via expectedTime against the current
    // playhead — so the audio clock does NOT leap to the demuxer's read-ahead
    // mediaTime, and the video does not hard-snap forward. That leap was the
    // "jumps 1–3s ahead on rate change" regression.
    //
    // None of this may be skipped while the context is SUSPENDED, which is
    // what pause() leaves behind — and requiring "running" here skipped all of
    // it, so a rate change made from a paused player re-anchored nothing.
    // getAudioClock() maps the whole span since the anchor through the
    // CURRENT rate, so on resume the entire pre-change history was re-scaled:
    // anchored at media 108.716, played 6.82s at 1x to a pause at 115.532,
    // then 1x → 0.25x gave 108.716 + 6.82 * 0.25 = 110.42 — the clock reported
    // 110.427 and the picture, which may not go back over frames it has
    // already shown, froze for the 5.1s hole. At 0.25x that is 20 seconds of
    // still image. A suspended context is the ideal place to do this work:
