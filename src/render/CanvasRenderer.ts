 * element directly.
 *
 * They used to wrap it — `new VideoFrame(videoElement)` — and that construction
 * succeeds on Firefox Android while the upload behind it does not: the element
 * holds a hardware surface Firefox can't read back for a CPU texture upload, so
 * every frame arrived as "tex(Sub)Image[23]D: Failed to retrieve source bytes
 * for CPU upload" and the canvas stayed black through perfectly good playback.
 * gl.getError() reports NO_ERROR for it, so none of the fallbacks below fire.
 * Uploading the element itself takes the browser's accelerated video-texture
 * path instead, which is the one every WebGL video site depends on.

   *
   * Measured 2026-09-19 (Chrome 153, macOS 26, HDR display, /tmp/hdr10.mp4,
   * pixels read back from a screencapture of the composited display):
   * whenever every quad in the frame qualifies, Chromium's Mac compositor
   * gives the whole frame to CoreAnimation as CALayers
   * (Compositing.Renderer.CALayerResult bucket 0 on a bare page and in
   * fullscreen), and the layer holding a rec2100-pq canvas is shown
   * tone-mapped to SDR — red bar 234,53,36, correct colours, no headroom.
   * An RGBA16F drawing buffer changes nothing (same 234,53,36), and
   * configureHighDynamicRange({mode:"extended"}) changes nothing;
   * drawingBufferToneMapping is not in Chrome 153 at all. The app page only
   * showed HDR windowed because a backdrop-filter in it failed the promotion
   * (bucket 19) and the frame was drawn by the SkiaRenderer, whose HDR
   * surfaces are extended-sRGB float — red 255,0,21. With
   * --disable-features=UseCALayerContentsHeadroom (Chromium's Metal HDR
   * copier instead of the macOS 26 contentsHeadroom attribute) the same PQ
   * layer shows as HDR, so the loss is in that new path.
   *
   * Two different non-zero corner radii on the canvas make cc render it
   * through a render pass of its own; the pass texture is viz's extended-sRGB
   * float, and that is what the CALayer receives — promotion still succeeds
   * (bucket 0) but the bare page, windowed and fullscreen, now composites
   * the same pixels as the app page (255,0,16). Uniform radii would not do:
   * they are applied on the quad itself and the PQ surface would still go
   * to the layer. The rounding is 1px and 2px on the top corners, under the
   * host's own clip when it is rounded and at the screen corners in
   * fullscreen, so nothing shows. Mac + Chromium only: that is where it was
   * measured, and elsewhere it would only cost a render pass.

   * NOTE: `readPixels` is a GPU synchronisation point — it flushes the command
   * queue and waits — so its cost is set by whatever is already queued, not by
   * the 256 pixels. On a 4K 12-bit source (RGBA16F, ~66MB a frame) samples were
   * measured at up to 21ms of blocked main thread here, and MoviElement's
   * ambient loop has seen 44ms in the field.
   *
   * A PBO + fenceSync rewrite was tried to make that asynchronous and was
   * MEASURABLY WORSE, on the same machine and file: p90 11.5ms -> 23.5ms, max
   * 21.4ms -> 121.7ms, main-thread long tasks 5 -> 20 over the same 40s. In
   * Chrome the WebGL context lives in the GPU process, so clientWaitSync and

      // treats as the GPU dropping us and answers by tearing the player down:
      // the brand-new player was destroyed microseconds after being built, and
      // playback stopped dead at idle with nothing on screen.

      // Still connected means the canvas outlives this renderer. Leave it be.
