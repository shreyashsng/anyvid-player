// Largest bytes= range asked for in ONE request. The window a stream fills is
// still MAX_STREAM_BUFFER_SIZE / the whole file; this only splits it into
// chunks, which the loop fetches back to back.
//
// Reason: CDNs that pace a long-lived response serve a SHORT range at full
// link speed and then throttle to roughly the stream's own bitrate. Measured
// against googlevideo on a 28MB audio track: 4MB in 0.42s (~10 MB/s), 8MB in
// 2.0s, and 12MB+ delivered 377KB in 12s — parked at ~30 KB/s. Asking for the
// whole file (which a small one did, since it fits the buffer) therefore made
// the demuxer's open wait ~18s for bytes it should have had in under a second;
// that was the entire startup delay on a split-audio YouTube source.
//
// Two sizes, because the two chunks are asked for different reasons:
//
//   OPEN — the first one. Small, so the demuxer's first read is answered in a
//   fraction of a second. That is the case above.
//
//   FILL — every one after it. Those exist to build a buffer, and 4MB is the
//   wrong size for that on a heavy rung: at 8K (~60 Mbps) it is barely half a
//   second of video per request, so the stream spends its time paying TTFB
//   (measured 30-500ms each) instead of filling. The buffer then never gets
//   ahead, which is what a switch to a high rung feels like. 8MB is the
//   largest the CDN still served whole in the measurement above, so take it.
// 4MB, and NOT smaller — tried. Shrinking this to 512KB on the theory that the
// open chunk was the wait made it seventeen times worse: `loadedmetadata` went
// from 1646ms to 28807ms on the same warm click. Whatever the demuxer needs to
// open, it is not answered by one small range, and the fill loop taking over
// from there is nowhere near as fast as one big request.

// eviction. Format-agnostic: we don't assume where metadata lives, we

// How much of the FILE HEAD to keep for the life of the source, out of bytes
// we were downloading anyway.
//
// The opening bytes are the one region every fresh demuxer re-reads, and the
// sliding window is the one place they never survive: the very first stream
// starts at 0, a metadata read then seeks the stream elsewhere (MKV Cues at
// EOF), and when it comes back the window restarts at 823 — the EBML header
// is gone. Nothing above 0 is affected, so the loss is invisible to playback
// but total for anyone re-opening the file: the thumbnail demuxer's probe
// read at offset 0 missed the borrow by 823 bytes and paid a 2MB range fetch
// (1.6s of the ~2.1s a first hover took on a 1.5MB/s link).
//
// One megabyte was sized for that probe read and nothing more, and it is not
// what a demuxer needs to OPEN a file. A 3.9GB MKV shows the gap exactly: its
// own open walked the head out to ~4.2MB (offsets 0, 31719, 556007, 1080295,
// 1604583, 2128871, 2653159, 3177447, 3701735, half a megabyte at a time), and
// the thumbnail demuxer has to walk the same ground when it opens its own
// instance later.
//
// While playback starts at zero that costs nothing — the reads land in the
// main sliding window and borrow for free. RESUMING is what exposes it: the
// resume seek moves the window to the middle of the file, the head region goes
// with it, and the only thing left covering the start is this cache. The
// thumbnail open then borrowed contiguously up to offset 988949 — the last
// 32KB read that fits under 1MB — and fell off the end at 1021717, paying two
// 2MB range fetches to read on to ~3.95MB. That is 1.9s of the ~4s a first
// hover took after a resume, and it is why it only ever happened after one.
//
// Sized to the opening fetch (see startStream) so it holds what the source has
// ALREADY downloaded rather than asking for more: on a resume the first 4MB
// still streams past before the seek moves the window, so this is free.
