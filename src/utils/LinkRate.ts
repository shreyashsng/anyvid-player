 * The pre-play probe used to spend a request and ~3MB measuring a rung it
 * often wasn't going to play. A rate measured minutes ago describes the same
 * link, and the confirm pass — which reads the head of the rung we DO open and
 * keeps those bytes — re-measures it for free on every load. Stale entries are
 * ignored rather than trusted: a link changes (wifi → cellular), and the first
 * load after that should measure again.
 *
 * The link belongs to the device, not to whatever is playing, so everything
 * that measures or needs it shares this one record: the multi-source pre-play
 * probe, and the adaptive engines, which otherwise each open on a blind guess
 * of their own (Shaka assumes 1 Mbps; dash.js ships lastBitrateCachingInfo but
 * in v5 that persists only language/codec, no bitrate). Whichever played last
 * teaches whichever plays next.

 * throughput rounded to 25kbps, absent on Safari and Firefox, and on a fresh
