/**
 * Take over the `<video>` elements a page already has.
 *
 * A page that was built around `<video>` — or around video.js, which is a
 * `<video>` with a script on top — should not have to be rewritten to gain a
 * demuxer. `upgradeVideoElements()` walks the document, puts a `<movi-player>`
 * where each `<video>` was, and carries its attributes and its children across:
 * the sources, the caption tracks, the poster, `data-setup`. What was declared
 * stays declared.
 *
 * The old element is kept, hidden, and wired to the new one, because a page's
 * JavaScript holds references to it: `video.play()`, `video.currentTime = 30`,
 * `video.addEventListener("ended", …)` all keep working, and keep meaning the
 * same thing, now that the player is what answers them. Existing code does not
 * know anything changed — which is the point.
 *
 * ```js
 * import { upgradeVideoElements } from "movi-player";
 *
 * upgradeVideoElements();                       // every <video> on the page
 * upgradeVideoElements("video.player");         // just these
 * upgradeVideoElements(document.querySelector("#hero"));
 *
 * const stop = upgradeVideoElements({ watch: true });   // …and future ones
 * ```
 *
 * A page opts a video out with `data-movi-ignore` — on the `<video>` itself or
 * on anything around it:
 *
 * ```html
 * <video data-movi-ignore src="clip.mp4" controls></video>
 * <section data-movi-ignore> …videos left alone… </section>
 * ```

 *    quality keys are not video.js's own — `label`, `res`, `size` come from
 *    whichever switcher plugin the site uses — so all of them are read.
 *  - Failing both, the <video>'s own <source> children, which is the ladder
 *    written in plain HTML and the one every skin is built over anyway.
 *
 * The first of those to offer more than one rung wins; a single rung is not a
 * ladder and leaves the ordinary src path alone.
 *
