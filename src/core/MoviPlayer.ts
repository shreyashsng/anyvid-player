   *     — MediaCapabilities is advisory, and Safari has been caught answering
   *     "supported" for 4K AV1 that isConfigSupported then refused.
   *  2. Failing that, is there a browser SOFTWARE decoder? Failing that, the
   *     player's own FFmpeg (WASM) takes it — which is why `playable` is true
   *     for nearly anything with a video track.
   *  3. Without hardware, it comes down to cost: width × height × fps × the
   *     codec's work factor × playback rate, against the budget for this class
   *     of device — the same two constants the player's ABR uses, calibrated on
   *     a phone that could not produce a frame of 1440p AV1 and the 1080p H.264
   *     it plays without complaint.
   *  4. MediaCapabilities gets a veto over "smooth": when the browser says a
   *     configuration will not be smooth, that is believed.
   *
   * Audio is reported but never decides it. Every audio track goes through the
   * software decoder already, and audio decode is a rounding error next to
   * video's.

        //    already concluded there was no tail here while this one decided
        //    there was. Only ours to read when the audio comes through THIS
        //    loop; split audio has its own demuxer and never sets it, hence the
        //    same `!audioDemuxer` guard the block above carries.

    // video-only tail; with the queue at its cap (which it always is once the
    // sound stops gating the demuxer) the delta-drop then ran for the entire

    // 22.1s, 28.1s, 34.1s, 40.1s, 46.1s, almost exactly 6s apart — and at every
    // one of them the stash was holding 176 to 197 packets (~3s of picture) and
    // the audio buffer read 2.07 to 2.23s against a 2.0s cap. The picture
    // stopped while three seconds of it sat one function call away. Then audio
    // drained under the cap, the gate opened, the stash flooded back, the
    // renderer jumped to ~66, read-ahead re-engaged, audio overshot 2.0 again,
    // and the whole cycle repeated for the length of the file.
    //
    // Same shape and same reasoning as the two carve-outs above: bounded (the
    // stash only shrinks), self-clearing (once it is empty the cap applies
    // again next tick), and the audio DECODER queue gate above still holds, so
    // this cannot flood anything.

    // prevent: the picture has run out while the cushion is still over its cap.
    //
    // Coming back from a background tab is where it bites. The hidden-tab pump
    // schedules a deeper cushion — 3.1s measured against the 2.0s cap — and the
    // foreground recovery then flushes the video decoder, clears the renderer
    // queue and drops the read-ahead stash, all on purpose. So at the moment of
    // return the audio side is a full second OVER its ceiling and the video
    // side is at zero, and none of the three carve-outs above is standing:
    // _videoResumeTarget cleared the instant the first frame passed it (63ms
    // in), the stash was just dropped, and "buffering" has not happened yet.
    //
    // The gate therefore closes and the demuxer reads NOTHING for as long as
    // the cushion takes to drain under the cap. Read off the session this came
    // from, twice: recovery at 43.471, first frame at 43.545, gate shut,
    // `Stall detected: buffers empty for 500ms` at 44.462 — 917ms of an idle
    // demuxer, a decoder with nothing to do, and an empty renderer. Then
    // buffering makes bufferingForVideo true, the gate opens, the queue
    // refills, playback resumes, the cushion is STILL over the cap, and the
    // whole thing goes round again. Three times in two seconds, each one
    // pausing the clock and suspending the AudioContext, until the audio clock
    // stopped advancing (104.374s logged twice a full second apart) and the
    // picture ran far enough ahead for the desync detector to fire a corrective
    // seek.
    //
    // bufferingForVideo already concedes the whole argument — it exists so the
    // cap cannot hold shut the reads that would end a wait for picture. It just
    // concedes it one stall too late. This is the same rule, before the stop
    // rather than after it.
    //
    // Same shape as the three above: bounded (it clears the moment the queue is
    // off the floor), self-limiting (the video cap and the audio DECODER queue
    // gate both still apply), and it cannot leave the audio ceiling lifted the
    // way `_videoResumeTarget !== -1` once did, because the queue climbing back

   * Arm the deferred preview warm-up, and keep re-arming it until playback has
   * actually settled.
   *
   * The delay exists to keep the second WASM module + WebCodecs decoder out of
   * the first seconds of PLAYBACK. It used to be a single timer started when
   * load() finished, which quietly assumes play() follows immediately — and on
   * a local file it does not. A FileSource preload reads 20×2MB before play()
   * is even reachable, so on an 11 GB MKV the 12s grace was already spent by
   * the time the first frame went up: the warm-up landed ~4.5s into playback,
   * stood a second isolated WASM instance up, re-opened the same 11 GB file
   * through the same main-thread Asyncify reads, and the audio cushion the
   * (all-software) decoder was holding collapsed into a stall that then made
   * no progress at all for six seconds, until MoviElement's stuck watchdog
   * seeked out of it.
   *
   * So measure the grace against playback, not load, and never start the
   * warm-up while the pipeline is already struggling — buffering and seeking
   * are precisely when the competing decode is least affordable. A source that
   * is simply sitting paused is not competing with anything, so it still warms
   * on schedule; if the user scrubs before any of that, the seek path lazy-inits
   * on demand (initPreviewPipeline is idempotent).
