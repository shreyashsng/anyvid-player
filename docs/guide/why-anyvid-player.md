## Alternatives

Which player fits your use case?

- **[video.js](https://videojs.com/), [Plyr](https://plyr.io/), [Vidstack](https://vidstack.io/), [Media Chrome](https://www.media-chrome.org/)** — polished UI players for browser-**native** formats (MP4/WebM) and HLS/DASH streams. They can't open a raw MKV, HEVC or AV1 file. Use Movi-Player instead when your source isn't a format the browser already decodes.
- **[hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js), [dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js), [Shaka Player](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player)** — streaming *engines* for adaptive HLS/DASH; they need content pre-packaged server-side and don't play arbitrary local files. Movi-Player plays those streams **and** raw files through one canvas pipeline.
- **[ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm)** — an FFmpeg-in-WASM *transcode/processing library*, not a player: it CPU-decodes (heavy, no GPU) and ships no UI. Movi-Player uses WebCodecs for **GPU-accelerated** decode and gives you a finished player. Reach for it when you want playback, not a transcoding toolkit.
- **[libmedia](https://github.com/zhaohappy/libmedia)** — the closest peer: a WASM + WebCodecs media SDK that also plays many formats. Movi-Player's difference is packaging — a drop-in `<movi-player>` web component with a batteries-included UI (HDR, chapters, multi-audio, subtitles, ambient mode, Document PiP, encrypted playback) rather than a lower-level toolkit.

In short, Movi-Player is a practical **alternative to video.js / hls.js / Shaka Player** for non-native files, and a friendlier, GPU-accelerated **alternative to ffmpeg.wasm / libmedia** when you want a player rather than a library.

## Key Advantages

### 1. No Server-Side Processing

Other players require server-side transcoding for:

- Format conversion (MKV → MP4)
- Codec transcoding (HEVC → H.264)
- HLS/DASH packaging

**Movi-Player processes everything in the browser.**

```typescript
// Direct MKV playback - no server conversion needed!
<movi-player src="video.mkv" controls></movi-player>
```

### 2. HDR Content Support

Movi-Player is the only web player with full HDR support:

```typescript
const videoTrack = player.getVideoTracks()[0];

if (videoTrack.isHDR) {
  console.log("HDR Format:", videoTrack.colorTransfer);
  // "smpte2084" (HDR10) or "arib-std-b67" (HLG)
}
```

### 3. Multi-Track Without Processing

Switch audio/subtitle tracks without server-side extraction:

```typescript
// Get all audio tracks
const audioTracks = player.getAudioTracks();
// [{ id: 0, language: 'eng' }, { id: 1, language: 'jpn' }]

// Switch to Japanese audio
player.selectAudioTrack(1);
```

### 4. Local File Privacy

Play files directly from user's device:

```typescript
import { FileSource } from "movi-player/player";

// File never leaves the browser
const source = new FileSource(userSelectedFile);
player.load({ type: "file", file: userSelectedFile });
```

::: info Privacy Benefit
User files are never uploaded to any server. All processing happens locally.

## Migration from Other Players

### From video.js

**Before** — video.js requires the script, the stylesheet, the placeholder `<video>` element, and a JS call to attach the player:

```html
<link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/8.10.0/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet" />

<video id="my-video" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" data-setup="{}">
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

```js
import videojs from "video.js";
import "video.js/dist/video-js.css";

const player = videojs("my-video", {
  controls: true,
  autoplay: false,
  preload: "auto",
});

player.on("ended", () => console.log("done"));
```

**After** — Movi Player ships as a custom element. Side-effect import registers `<movi-player>`; no stylesheet, no `videojs()` call, no placeholder `<video>`:

```html
<movi-player id="my-video" src="video.mp4" controls preload="auto"></movi-player>
```

```js
import "movi-player";

const player = document.getElementById("my-video");
player.addEventListener("ended", () => console.log("done"));
```

The element implements the same `play()` / `pause()` / `currentTime` / events surface as `<video>`, so most existing logic carries over with a `getElementById` instead of a `videojs()` factory call.

#### Or change nothing at all

If the markup is not yours to edit — a CMS template, a third-party embed, a
page you would rather not touch — take the `<video>` elements over instead:

From a CDN this needs no JavaScript at all — `data-upgrade` on the script tag
does it:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/movi-player/dist/element.js"
        data-upgrade data-upgrade-watch></script>
```

Or call it:

```js
import { upgradeVideoElements } from "movi-player";

upgradeVideoElements();                          // every <video> on the page
upgradeVideoElements("video.hero");              // only these
upgradeVideoElements({ watch: true });           // …and any added later
upgradeVideoElements({ attributes: { thumb: "" } });   // with extras applied
```

Each `<video>` is replaced by a `<movi-player>` carrying its attributes and its
children — sources, caption tracks, thumbnail tracks, poster, `data-setup`. The
element's `id` moves too, so `getElementById` keeps finding "the player".

The original element stays in the page, hidden, with its API pointed at the new
one, so code that still holds it keeps working:

```js
const video = document.getElementById("hero-native"); // the old element
video.play();                 // plays through movi-player
video.currentTime = 60;       // seeks it
video.addEventListener("ended", …);   // fires from the player
```

A `<video>` that should stay a `<video>` says so with `data-movi-ignore` — on
the element, or on anything around it to leave a whole section alone. The
upgrade skips it, and so does the browser extensions' takeover:

```html
<video data-movi-ignore src="clip.mp4" controls></video>
```

#### The markup carries over as-is

The pieces video.js reads from the element are read here too, so a page can
usually change `<video class="video-js">` to `<movi-player>` and stop:

```html
<movi-player class="video-js" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360"
             poster="poster.jpg" data-setup='{"muted": true}'>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track kind="captions" src="en.vtt" srclang="en" label="English" default>
  <track kind="metadata" label="thumbnails" src="thumbs.vtt">
  <p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript…</p>
</movi-player>
```

- `data-setup` is applied as attributes — `controls`, `autoplay`, `muted`,
  `loop`, `poster`, `preload`, `width`, `height`, the first of `sources`, and
  `spriteThumbnails`. An attribute written out longhand wins over the JSON.
- `<track kind="captions">` / `kind="subtitles"` become subtitle tracks, and
  `default` selects one.
- `<track kind="metadata" label="thumbnails">` — video.js's spelling — becomes
  scrub previews: a sprite VTT with `#xywh=` rectangles, or one image per cue.
- Unslotted children like `<p class="vjs-no-js">` are not rendered.

The `videojs-sprite-thumbnails` options work unchanged, either through
`data-setup` or as a property:

```js
player.storyboard = {
  url: "sprite-{index}.jpg",
  width: 160, height: 90, columns: 5, rows: 5, interval: 3,
};
```

#### Multiple sources / split source

Movi Player accepts child `<source>` elements just like `<video>`, so the `<source>` fallback pattern keeps working:

```html
<movi-player controls>
  <source src="movie.av1.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=av01.0.05M.08" />
  <source src="movie.h264.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</movi-player>
```

In addition, Movi extends the syntax with `kind="audio"` so you can serve a video-only file alongside a separate audio track (DASH-style split source) — something native `<video>` and video.js can't do without manual MSE wiring:

```html
<movi-player controls>
  <source src="video-only.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="audio-only.m4a" type="audio/mp4" kind="audio" />
</movi-player>
```

The two streams are kept in sync automatically. The same is available via JS:

```js
player.source({
  video: { src: "video-only.mp4", type: "video/mp4" },
  audio: { src: "audio-only.m4a", type: "audio/mp4" },
});
```

### From hls.js

**Before** — hls.js wires up MSE manually on a `<video>` element:

```html
<video id="my-video" controls></video>
```

```js
import Hls from "hls.js";

const video = document.getElementById("my-video");
if (Hls.isSupported()) {
  const hls = new Hls();
  hls.loadSource("https://example.com/stream.m3u8");
  hls.attachMedia(video);
  hls.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, () => video.play());
}
```

**After** — Movi Player handles HLS internally via hls.js; just point `src` at the manifest:

```html
<movi-player src="https://example.com/stream.m3u8" controls autoplay></movi-player>
```

```js
import "movi-player";
```

For DRM-protected HLS streams, add the `drm` and `licenseurl` attributes — Movi switches to the native `<video>` + EME pipeline automatically.
