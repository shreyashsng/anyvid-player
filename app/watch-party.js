/**
 * Watch party — one Durable Object per room code.
 *
 * The code IS the room. `idFromName(code)` maps any string two people agree
 * on to the same object, so there is no room registry, no row to create and
 * nothing to clean up: a room exists exactly as long as someone is connected
 * to it. Whatever the host types — "chai", "1234", a uuid — lands both sides
 * in the same place.
 *
 * What travels is playback STATE, never media. The party is only offered on
 * URL sources precisely because both sides have to be able to reach the same
 * bytes themselves; a local file cannot be shared this way and the client
 * refuses to start a party on one.
 *
 * The room code is what people share and is NOT a credential — open
 * ?party=movie and you land in that room as a follower, able to do nothing.
 * Claiming the chair means presenting the one secret in D1, checked by the
 * worker before it ever reaches here (see handlePartyHost). So a stranger
 * who guesses a code joins; they do not take it over.
 *
 * Time is kept by this object, not by either browser. Two machines' clocks
 * routinely differ by seconds, which is far more than the drift we are trying
 * to correct, so every state message is stamped with the DO's own clock and
 * clients measure their offset to it by ping/pong. A follower then knows what
 * "0:41.2 as of 380ms ago" means in its own terms.
